# Etch-a-Sketch

This is my version of the [Etch-a-Sketch project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project?ref=lnav) from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com). 

My final product can be viewed [here](https://leila-alderman.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).

This project used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a drawing area with a user-defined grid density. The grid squares change color when a mouse hovers over them. Additional functionality includes the ability to set random drawing colors and to slowly increase the opacity of each square on hover.
